# O(1) will be faster than O(3)

# O(3) will be faster than O(n)

# O(n) will be faster than O(n2)

# O(n2) will be faster than O(n3)

# Whenever we have 2 nested loop the time complexity will be O(n2)

# example
# for i in range(n):
#     for j in range(n):


# whenever our counter is incremented by multiplication factor or divisable factor
# then the time conplexity will be O(logn) 

# example

# counter = 1
# while counter < n:
#     counter *= 2

# counter = n
# while counter > 0:
#     counter /= 2
